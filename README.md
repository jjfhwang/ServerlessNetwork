# ServerlessNetwork

## Description

ServerlessNetwork is a Python-based repository dedicated to the implementation of cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and tools. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and well-documented collection of cryptographic primitives, enabling developers and researchers to easily integrate secure communication and data protection functionalities into their applications. By focusing on clarity, correctness, and performance, ServerlessNetwork serves as a valuable resource for both educational purposes and practical application in secure system design. We strive to provide implementations that are easy to understand, audit, and deploy, contributing to a more secure digital landscape.

## Features

*   **Symmetric Encryption Algorithms:** Implementation of widely used symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with various key sizes and modes of operation (e.g., CBC, CTR, GCM). Provides secure and efficient data encryption capabilities.
*   **Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms:** Implementation of asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Enables secure key exchange and digital signatures.
*   **Hashing Algorithms:** Implementation of cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) and SHA-3 (Keccak). Used for data integrity verification and password storage.
*   **Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):** Implementation of KDFs such as PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) and Argon2. Securely derive cryptographic keys from passwords or other secrets.
*   **Digital Signature Schemes:** Implementation of digital signature schemes like ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). Provides authentication and non-repudiation for digital communications.

## Installation

To install ServerlessNetwork and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ServerlessNetwork.git
    cd ServerlessNetwork
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If a `requirements.txt` file doesn't exist, you can manually install the necessary packages. Common dependencies might include:

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    pip install pycryptodome
    ```

    **Note:** The `cryptography` package requires a C compiler and development headers to be installed on your system. Refer to the `cryptography` documentation for platform-specific installation instructions.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the implemented cryptographic algorithms and tools:

**1. AES Encryption and Decryption:**

Assuming you have an AES module (e.g., `aes.py`) with functions for encryption and decryption:

```python
from ServerlessNetwork.algorithms import aes

# Example usage
key = b'Sixteen byte key'  # AES-128 key
plaintext = b'This is a secret message.'

ciphertext, iv = aes.encrypt_aes_cbc(plaintext, key)  # Assuming you have an encrypt_aes_cbc function

print("Ciphertext:", ciphertext)

decrypted_text = aes.decrypt_aes_cbc(ciphertext, key, iv) # Assuming you have a decrypt_aes_cbc function

print("Decrypted text:", decrypted_text)

assert plaintext == decrypted_text
```

**2. SHA-256 Hashing:**

Assuming you have a SHA-256 module (e.g., `sha256.py`) with a function for hashing:

```python
from ServerlessNetwork.algorithms import sha256

# Example usage
message = b'This is the message to hash.'

hash_value = sha256.sha256_hash(message) # Assuming you have a sha256_hash function

print("SHA-256 Hash:", hash_value)
```

**3. RSA Key Generation and Encryption/Decryption:**

Assuming you have an RSA module (e.g., `rsa.py`) with functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption:

```python
from ServerlessNetwork.algorithms import rsa

# Example Usage
public_key, private_key = rsa.generate_rsa_key_pair(2048) # Assuming you have a generate_rsa_key_pair function

message = b"Sensitive data to protect."

encrypted_message = rsa.encrypt_rsa(message, public_key) # Assuming you have an encrypt_rsa function
print("Encrypted:", encrypted_message)

decrypted_message = rsa.decrypt_rsa(encrypted_message, private_key) # Assuming you have a decrypt_rsa function
print("Decrypted:", decrypted_message)

assert message == decrypted_message
```

**Note:**  Replace `ServerlessNetwork.algorithms.aes`, `ServerlessNetwork.algorithms.sha256`, and `ServerlessNetwork.algorithms.rsa` with the actual module paths in your project structure. Ensure that the functions called (e.g., `encrypt_aes_cbc`, `sha256_hash`, `generate_rsa_key_pair`) are implemented in those modules.
