# ServerlessNetwork

## Description

This repository provides a framework for creating and managing serverless network applications using Python. It simplifies the process of defining network topologies, deploying them to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda), and managing their lifecycle. The goal is to enable developers to build scalable and resilient network services without the complexities of traditional server-based infrastructure. By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure management, ServerlessNetwork allows you to focus on the core logic of your network application.

## Features

*   **Topology Definition:** Define network topologies using a declarative Python-based configuration. This allows you to specify the network components, their connections, and their properties in a clear and concise manner.
*   **Automated Deployment:** Automatically deploy your defined network topology to a serverless environment. The framework handles the creation of the necessary cloud resources, such as Lambda functions, API Gateways, and security groups.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Leverage event-driven principles to build highly responsive and scalable network services. Components can communicate with each other through asynchronous events, enabling loose coupling and improved resilience.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrated monitoring and logging capabilities provide insights into the performance and health of your serverless network. You can track key metrics, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add custom components, protocols, and cloud providers. This ensures that it can adapt to your specific needs and requirements.

## Installation

To install ServerlessNetwork and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ServerlessNetwork.git
    cd ServerlessNetwork
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies using pip:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Note: The `requirements.txt` file should contain the necessary packages, such as `boto3` for AWS integration.*

    Example `requirements.txt` content:
    ```
    boto3==1.26.131
    PyYAML==6.0
    ```

4.  **Configure your AWS credentials:**

    Ensure that you have configured your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.  This is required for deploying resources to AWS.

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

    You will need to provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. The IAM user/role you use must have sufficient permissions to create and manage Lambda functions, API Gateways, and other necessary AWS resources.

## Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use ServerlessNetwork:

1.  **Defining a Simple Network Topology:**

    Assume you have a file named `topology.yaml` that defines your network:

    ```yaml
    # topology.yaml
    components:
      - name: lambda_function_a
        type: lambda
        handler: handler_a.main
        runtime: python3.9
        memory: 128
      - name: lambda_function_b
        type: lambda
        handler: handler_b.main
        runtime: python3.9
        memory: 128

    connections:
      - source: lambda_function_a
        destination: lambda_function_b
        type: direct
    ```

    Now, use the framework to load and process the topology:

    ```python
    # main.py
    import yaml

    def load_topology(filepath):
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            return yaml.safe_load(f)

    def deploy_network(topology):
        # Placeholder for deployment logic.  In a real implementation,
        # this would create Lambda functions, API Gateways, etc., based
        # on the topology.
        print("Deploying network based on topology:")
        print(topology)
        # Implement deployment logic here using boto3 or other cloud provider SDK.
        pass

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        topology = load_topology('topology.yaml')
        deploy_network(topology)
    ```

    Create dummy handler files:

    ```python
    # handler_a.py
    def main(event, context):
        print("Lambda A received event:", event)
        # Invoke Lambda B (implementation omitted for brevity)
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': 'Hello from Lambda A'
        }
    ```

    ```python
    # handler_b.py
    def main(event, context):
        print("Lambda B received event:", event)
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': 'Hello from Lambda B'
        }
    ```

    Run the `main.py` script to initiate the deployment process (which currently only prints the topology):

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Simulating Events:**

    You can simulate events to test your serverless network:

    ```python
    # simulate_event.py
    import boto3
    import json

    lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda') # Ensure AWS credentials are configured

    def invoke_lambda(function_name, payload):
        response = lambda_client.invoke(
            FunctionName=function_name,
            InvocationType='RequestResponse',
            Payload=json.dumps(payload)
        )
        return response

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        event_data = {'message': 'Hello from the simulator!'}
        response = invoke_lambda('lambda_function_a', event_data) # Replace with your Lambda function name

        payload = json.loads(response['Payload'].read().decode('utf-8'))
        print("Lambda response:", payload)
    ```

    Run the `simulate_event.py` script to send an event to your Lambda function:

    ```bash
    python simulate_event.py
    ```

    *Note:  Replace `'lambda_function_a'` with the actual name of your deployed Lambda function.*
